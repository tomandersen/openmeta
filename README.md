OpenMeta

Tags and ratings for OS X.

This code will create Apple - like tags on systems back to 10.6, and sets Apple tags on 10.9+. 

There is also code to store and retrieve recently used Tags, clean up tag strings, etc. 

It now ONLY sets apple tags on 10.9 or later. 

The library is useful to get tags that are case preserved, case insensitive, etc.
